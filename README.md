AI-Powered Chatbot Web App Development

- Trained a Wit.AI-based chatbot to handle various user intents, such as helping users navigate the application, listing chatrooms, fetching messages, handling user authentication (login, registration, logout), and managing user posts in specific chatrooms.

- Called API to Get and Post data into the database

- Implemented password masking and dynamic feedback through emoticons to enhance user interaction.

- Worked within existing React.js architecture, integrating complex logic without altering the underlying codebase
